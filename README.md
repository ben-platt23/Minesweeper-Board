# Minesweeper-Board
Generates a minesweeper board into the console using a 2D array.

Asks the user for dimensions of the board and randomly places bombs with correct indicators for mines.

The number of mines are the number of columns plus the number of rows divided by 2.  E.g. if you have a 12 by 8 board you will have 10 mines on the board.  If the board is 10 by 9, there will also be 10 mines.

Example: Compiled 5x5 board
